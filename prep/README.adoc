== Who did what

Code architecture and Rendering:

* Karthik

Modelling and Animation:

* Chris and Oleksandr

== Source code
https://gitlab.ensimag.fr/chakkak/3d

== Difficulties and Future scope
Due to current pandemic situation, we had lot of challenges to manage submissions of all the subjects on time.
Though we were passionate and wanted to do more in this project, we had to make some design sacrifices to balance time between multiple submission.
For ex:

* There could have been inter-boid animation
* More interesting/complex shapes in procedural animation
* Bubbles
* Interaction between fishes and environment
* Caustics etc...
